Mission OSM Base

This directory contains an abbreviated group of files from Tom N Harris'
Public Scripts, adapted to be used as the base for a custom OSM for a fan
mission or campaign. To use it, search across the files for "CHANGEME" and
put in real information. Add your script headers to custom.h and your code to
custom.cpp, then compile with the MinGW toolchain. Three OSM files will be
generated: YOURNAME-t1.osm, YOURNAME-t2.osm, and YOURNAME-ss2.osm. Rename the
appropriate file to YOURNAME.osm and place it in your mission's root directory.

Remember that the licensing terms require you to make your source code available
along with your compiled OSM; while it would be unusual (and size-expensive) to
include it in the mission ZIP file, you are encouraged to make it available in a
separate ZIP archive through the same distribution channels.
